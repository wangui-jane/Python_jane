# Lab — Create Visualizations in Excel (README)

## Reflection

### Line Chart (Revenue vs. Profits)
- **Alternative:** Change from “Line with Markers” to a **Smooth Line** (smoothed curves, no markers).  
  - **Effect:** Emphasizes overall trend and removes visual clutter, but sacrifices precise yearly data points—so clarity improves for trend‐spotting but exact values are less obvious.  
- **Alternative:** Use a **Combo Chart** (columns for Revenue, line for Profit).  
  - **Effect:** Highlights the scale difference between revenue and profit more clearly, helping viewers compare absolute revenue bars against profit line at a glance.

### Column Chart (Product Revenue by Country)
- **Alternative:** Switch from **Stacked Column** to **Clustered Column**.  
  - **Effect:** Makes it easier to compare individual product categories across countries side by side, but hides the combined total revenue per country.  
- **Alternative:** Use a **100% Stacked Column**.  
  - **Effect:** Shows percentage share of each product category within each country—good for relative composition, but obscures absolute revenue differences.

### Pie Chart (Revenue Comparison by Age Group)
- **Alternative:** Replace Pie with a **Bar Chart** (horizontal bars).  
  - **Effect:** Improves readability of small segments and makes precise value comparisons easier, especially when age‐group slices are similar in size.  
- **Alternative:** Add **Data Callouts** instead of in‐slice labels.  
  - **Effect:** Prevents label overlap on small slices and keeps the chart area cleaner, though it adds visual connectors that can be distracting.

## Challenge Activity

- **Tried a Treemap** on the Product Revenue dataset:  
  - **Effect:** Provides a space-efficient, hierarchical view of category revenues. It conveys both absolute and relative size of each product segment more intuitively than the stacked column.

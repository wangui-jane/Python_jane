# Lab Part 1: “Ask the Question”

## 1. Research Question
**Which ice-cream flavor is most popular among three age groups—Kids (0–12), Teens (13–19), and Adults (20+)?**

## 2. Project Benefit
Knowing each demographic’s favorite flavor helps ice-cream shops and retailers:
- Stock the right flavors in the right locations
- Reduce waste from unsold flavors
- Tailor marketing campaigns to customer preferences

## 3. Analysis Type
**Descriptive Analysis**  
- Compute counts and percentages of flavor choices by age group  
- Use cross-tabulations and bar charts to summarize historical survey data

## 4. Data Elements Needed
- **Respondent ID** (unique)  
- **Age Group** (Kids, Teens, Adults)  
- **Favorite Flavor** (Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, Mint, etc.)  
- **Survey Date** (to detect any seasonal trends)

## 5. Potential Data Sources
- **Kaggle**: “Ice-Cream Flavor Preferences” survey datasets  
- **Data.gov**: National Food Consumption Surveys (may include dessert modules)  
- **UCI Repository**: Food-preference or consumer survey datasets  
- **Google Forms Templates**: Public “Flavor Preference” survey examples

## 6. Reflection Questions

### a) Why identify the question before starting?

- **Prevents** wasted effort on irrelevant data or analyses

### b) Which open data sources did you find?
- Kaggle “Ice-Cream Flavor Preferences” dataset  
- Data.gov food-consumption CSV files  
- UCI Machine Learning Repository food-preference collections  
- Google Forms public survey templates
